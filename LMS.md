Phase 2 (Weeks 1–2) System Design

Objective: Improve the main store’s Logistics and ordering processing
 
1. User Authentication and Authorization (Week-1) 
Objective : 

Our primary focus is to implement a user authentication and authorization system that guarantees the safety and effectiveness of user data. Additionally, we aim to incorporate role-based access control for both staff and customers, ensuring the most appropriate and secure access to data.
Task:
User Verification and Login Security
Create a seamless registration process that includes a necessary email verification step to enhance account security. This multi-faceted task involves setting up user accounts, gathering pertinent information, and implementing measures to confirm the validity of user email addresses, mitigating the threat of unauthorized accounts.
Login Protection with Password Encryption
Implement advanced security protocols to safeguard sensitive data by encrypting user passwords. This crucial step ensures that confidential credentials are protected both at rest and in transit, bolstering security measures. 
Implement Effective Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Establish a robust RBAC system to better manage roles and permissions for various user types, such as staff and customers. Clearly define the authorized actions and access levels for each role, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience for all users.

2. Order Placement Functionality (Weeks-2)

Objective: Our goal is to improve the customer experience and ensure accurate order submissions by making the order placement process more efficient and seamless. 
Tasks:
User-friendly Order form
 Develop a user-friendly and intuitive order placement form that allows customers to specify their preferences, including fabric quality, quantity, sizes, and colors or customer request and important message.
Seamless Data flow
 Establish a seamless connection between the fronted and back-end systems to ensure efficient data flow during order submission.
Validation Mechanism
implement robust validation mechanisms to verify the accuracy and completeness of customer-provided order details. Store validated orders securely in the database for processing.
Order confirmation notifications
 Configure an automated email notification system to promptly inform customers of their successful order placements. Include essential order confirmation information and estimated delivery schedules in these notifications.
Developing a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) prototype
This allows you to test the look and feel of the system with users early on in the development process to make the necessary adjustments before implementing the final design.
